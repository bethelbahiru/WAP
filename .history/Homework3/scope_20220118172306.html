            var b = 10;
            var c = function(a, b, c) {
            var x = 10;
            document.write(x);
            document.write(a);
            var f = function(a, b, c) {
            b = a;
            document.write(b);
            b = c;
            var x = 5;
            }
            f(a,b,c);
            document.write(b);
